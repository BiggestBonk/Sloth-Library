# User Story/ Use Case
As a user I want to be to check out books by entering the id of the selected book and the customer's id accordingly. Checking a book out to someone should make it unavailable and file it under their name.

### What I Contributed 


* Mutation functionality to handle getting books out
* Routing 
* Database calls
* Styling
* Data
* Models/Interfaces
